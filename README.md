I created a Budget Tracker that helps you manage your money. You can set your total income, 
add various expenses, and see your remaining balance. It shows a list of all your expenses for easy tracking.
It tracks how much money you have left and gets negative amounts. If you don't enter anything,
there will be an alert that lets you know that you have to enter an amount in order for it to work.
